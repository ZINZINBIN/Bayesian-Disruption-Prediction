## Introduction
<div>
    This is github repository of advanced research for disruption prediction using bayesian deep learning. The previous research for disruption prediction is based on multimodal learning. The main issues in disruption prediciton is to prevent the occurrance of false alarms. The bayesian approach can handle with this issue since the uncertainty now can be given, which means that the classifier can be trained by the generative approach, not by the discriminative appraoch. The disruption predictor, or the classifier is the generative classifier for our case. We can analyze the disruptive data in more detail using uncertainty and casual anaysis based on bayesian approach.
